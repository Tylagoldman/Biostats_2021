#str displays the internal structure of data 
#data frame looks like a spreadsheet and contains various data 
#'num"- floating point numbers 
#'Ã“rd.factor" - ordereed factor-level of order in the data, for example, small to large

#population is data from the overall study 
#sample is a subset of data extracted from the population of data- needs to be unbias, hold variety 
#as sample size increases, variation decreases

#can observe whether data is normally distributed where mean=median 

#kurtosis- describes the shape/properties of the tail. 
#normal distribution- kurtosis = 0 
#negative kurtosis- data have a thin tail 
#positive kurtosis- data have a fat tail 
#THEREFORE- THE ABOVE DATA WEIGHT IS
